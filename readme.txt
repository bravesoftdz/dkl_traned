DKLang Translation Editor
=========================

This is a free GUI tool for creating and editing translation files (.lng) for 
applications using the DKLang Localization Package
(https://github.com/yktoo/dklang).

Program's features:

  - Translation using a dictionary (so-called Translation Repository).
  - Automatic tracking of source and translation mismatches. A difference log is
    generated when you open a project. This log shows you added and deleted 
    entries as compared to the language source file. New entries can then be
    automatically translated with the Translation Repository.
  - An extra translation file for displaying strings can be used. For example,
    when you translate into Ukrainian it would be more convenient to use Russian
    as a reference rather than English, given a Russian translation is already
    available.
