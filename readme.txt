DKLang Translation Editor
=========================

This is a free tool for creating and editing DKLang Localization Package using
application translations.

Program's features:

  - Translation using a dictionary (so-called Translation Repository).
  - Automatic tracking of source and translation discrepancies. On project open
    a difference log is generated showing you the entries added to or deleted
    from the translation. An option for autotranslation of new entries using the
    Translation Repository is also available.
  - A possibility of using an additional translation file to display the source
    values from. For example, when you wish to make a translation but it is more
    convenient to translate not from the original language but from another one,
    more close to the destination language.
